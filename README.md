# Champions League

Welcome to the Champions League project! This project includes both a backend server and a frontend client to provide a complete web application experience.

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BarelHeby/champions-league.git
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository. Then, run the following command to start the backend server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8002
```

This command will start the Django development server on your local machine, listening on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and port 8002.

### 3. Start the Frontend Client

Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the frontend directory, and run the following commands:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

- `cd frontend` : Changes the current directory to the frontend directory.
- `npm install` : Installs all the dependencies required for the frontend.
- `npm start` : Starts the React development server.

### 4. Access the Application

Once both the backend server and frontend client are running, you can access the application in your web browser in `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Login Credentials
